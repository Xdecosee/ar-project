# Action Types

**Note:** I was only given a list of the types of attacks that participants have performed in the past years of the challenge. Hence for the defending actions, I decided to just call them as defense1, defense2 and defense3.

| Attack Type    | Int    | Colour|
| --------|---------|-------|
| Normal  | 1 |Green|
| Reconnaissance | 2 |Yellow|
| SQL Injection | 3 |Orange|
| Semantic URL Attack | 4 |Pink|
| Command Injection | 5 |Purple|
| Remote Code Execution | 6 |Light Blue|
| URL Manipulation | 7 |Brown|
| Privilege Escalation | 8 |Blue|
| Directory Traversal Attack | 9 |Red|

| Defense Type    | Int    | Colour|
| --------|---------|-------|
| defense1 | 10 |Dark Green|
| defense2 | 11 |Gray|
| defense3 | 12 |Light Pink|
